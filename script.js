    I saw this error message today:

    Why is [insert beginner concept] so hard to understand?!

    This isn't a flex. I'm just venting.

    I thought I was the only one who felt this way:
    “I’m not smart enough to be a dev.”
    But I’ve seen so many others talk about it too.
    So if you're feeling that today—you're not alone.
    We just keep showing up.

    What I thought coding would feel like:

    What it actually feels like:
    🧯 “Why is margin-left doing this to me?”
    Still worth it, though.

    I used to think [limiting belief or misunderstanding]

    Learning to code isn’t just about JavaScript or HTML.
    It’s about dealing with:
    😵 Imposter syndrome
    ⏳ Frustration
    🔁 Repetition
    Mastering mindset is the real dev skill.

    `
    This one idea changed how I approach learning:
    💡 [Mindset shift — e.g., “progress over perfection”]
    I started showing up differently ever since.
    Not faster. Just more consistent.

    `
    Don’t chase [e.g. perfection / speed / virality]
    Chase [e.g. consistency / clarity / understanding]
    The results will come if the foundation is strong.

    `
    Every time I feel dumb or stuck while coding, I remind myself:
    This is growth.

    Struggle = leveling up.

    This one thought almost made me quit:
    “I should be further ahead by now.”

    If I could go back to Day 1 of my dev journey, I’d say:
    ✅ [Mindset advice or lesson]
    It would’ve saved me hours of frustration — and helped me focus.

    `
    Had to pause my learning for a while.
    Not starting over — just picking back up.
    Consistency isn’t perfection. It’s returning.
    Recommitment > Restart.

    Hard truth I needed to hear:
    “You’re not supposed to be good yet.”
    You’re supposed to be *learning*.
    Let that sink in.
    Beginner isn’t broken — it’s a phase. Don’t skip it.

    I stopped saying:
